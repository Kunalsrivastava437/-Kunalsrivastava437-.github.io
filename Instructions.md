Hey There ! My name is Kunal Srivastava, a CSE undergraduate 4th yr student.
As my hobby is sketching and Art & Craft and My interest was in programming, I decided to change my interest to Web Development.
I'm New to Web Development and continuously learning, I've made this website by learning and implementing sideways,
I know i'm not perfect now, but i'll be.

As it was the starting, the focus of this project demo website is on Front End Only.
Go to Homepage -> Sign UP -> Login -> Employee Portal Opens -> Add your tasks.

Note :- Once this website is fully completed, employees and Admin will be able to login seperately,
Employees can register their issues/complaints they are facing in the office campus and they will show in the Admin portal,
Admin can resolve the issues and it will be updated on the employee portal
